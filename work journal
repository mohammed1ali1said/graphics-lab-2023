first week: choosing a project
second week :  learning unity basic objects scenes how to use import and other things about 10 hours (to be able to use unity faster than to search for it each time )
third week : searching for material to import such as guns target  and also learning how to use blender because i had to use it for my target about 8 hours includes debugging because the shape of the target had many parts and needed a lot of time 
fourth week : creating a basic scene where i added all the imported material and other like walls camera guns colour and texture to walls and all the basics ( don't know exactly how much time it took )
next it was Passover (holiday) : i added  a lot of code files in c# such as the code for a target to respawn and die and take damage and guns to shoot with raycast and all the other code ( this took a lot of time like 8-10 hours daily for a week because sometime debugging would take forever this was like week 6-7 week 5 i didn't do anything if i recall right)
in week 7 i also added the levels and feedback (those 2 weeks i had a lot to learn too since c# is new to me ) basically the hard job was those two weeks 
8th week: 8th week is when i checked everything is going well ran it many times each time would check different thing to make sure it's working as intended and made the video that i have sent to slack
